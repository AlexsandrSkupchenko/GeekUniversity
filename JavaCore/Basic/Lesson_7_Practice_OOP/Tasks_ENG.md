1. Expand the problem about cats and plates of food.
2. Make sure that the plate with food could not get a negative amount of food
   (for example, there are 10 food in a bowl, and the cat is trying to eat 15-20)
3. Each cat needs to add a satiety field (when we create cats, they are hungry).
   If the cat managed to eat (there was enough food), satiety = true.
4. We believe that if the cat has little food in the plate, then he simply does not touch it,
   that is, it cannot be half full (this is done to simplify the program logic)
5. Create an array of cats and a plate of food, ask all cats to eat from this plate
   and then display information about the satiety of cats in the console.
6. Add a method to the plate that would add food to the plate.
