1. Specify an integer array consisting of elements 0 and 1.
   For example: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0].
   Using a loop and a condition, replace 0 with 1, 1 with 0;
2. Set an empty integer array of size 8. Using a loop,
   fill it with values ​​0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21;
3. Set the array [1, 5, 3, 2, 11, 4, 5, 2, 4, 8, 9, 1] to loop through it,
   and multiply numbers less than 6 by 2;
4. Create a square two-dimensional integer array (the number of rows and columns is the same),
   and using the cycle (s) fill its diagonal elements with ones;
5. ** Set a one-dimensional array and find the minimum and maximum elements in it
   (without using the Internet);
6. ** Write a method to which a non-empty one-dimensional integer array is passed,
   the method must return true if there is a place in the array
   where the sum of the left and right sides of the array are equal.
   Examples: checkBalance ([2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, || 10, 1]) → true,
   checkBalance ([1, 1, 1, || 2, 1]) → true,
   the border is shown by symbols | |, these characters are not included in the array.
7. **** Write a method that receives a one-dimensional array and a number n
   (can be positive or negative) as input,
   and the method must shift all array elements by n positions.
   To complicate the task, you cannot use auxiliary arrays.
