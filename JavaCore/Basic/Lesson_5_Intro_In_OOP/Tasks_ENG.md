* Create a class "Employee" with fields: name, position, email, phone, salary, age;
* The constructor of the class must fill in these fields when creating an object;
* Inside the "Employee" class, write a method that outputs information about the object to the console;
* Create an array of 5 employees
Example:
Person [] persArray = new Person [5]; // First, declare an array of objects
persArray [0] = new Person ("Ivanov Ivan", "Engineer", "ivivan@mailbox.com", "892312312", 30000, 30);
 // then for each cell of the array we set an object
persArray [1] = new Person (...);
...
persArray [4] = new Person (...);

* With the help of the cycle, display information only about employees over 40 years old;
