1. Write a console version of the client \ server application,
   in which the user can write messages, both on the client side and on the server side.
   Those. if you write "Hello" on the client side, press Enter,
   then the message should be sent to the server and printed there in the console.
   If you do the same on the server side, then the message is sent to the client
   and is printed on his console. There is one peculiarity
   to consider: a client or server can write several messages in a row.
   This situation needs to be handled correctly.
