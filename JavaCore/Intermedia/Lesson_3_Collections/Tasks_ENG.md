1. Create an array with a set of words (10-20 words, among which there must be duplicates).
   Find and display a list of unique words that make up an array (duplicates are not counted).
   Count how many times each word occurs.
2. Write a simple class Telephone Directory, which stores a list of surnames
   and telephone numbers. You can add entries to this phone book using the add () method.
   Use the get () method to search for a phone number by last name.
   It should be noted that under the same surname there can be several phones 
   (in the case of namesakes),
   then when requesting such a name, all phones should be displayed.
