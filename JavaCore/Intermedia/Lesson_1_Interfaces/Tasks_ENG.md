1. Create three classes Human, Cat, Robot, which do not inherit from one class.
   These classes must be able to run and jump 
   (the methods simply output information about the action to the console).
2. Create two classes: a treadmill and a wall, when passing through which,
   participants must perform appropriate actions (run or jump),
   print the result to the console (ran successfully, could not run, etc.).
3. Create two arrays: with participants and obstacles,
   and make all the participants go through this set of obstacles.
4*. Obstacles have a length (for a path) or a height (for a wall),
   and participants have restrictions on running and jumping.
   If the participant could not pass one of the obstacles,
   then he does not go further down the list of obstacles.
5*. Complete a task with enumerations (the file is attached in the materials).
