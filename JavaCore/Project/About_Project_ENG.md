Client-Server Application Project (Chat)
  The server side was made on the basis of sockets, and was written from scratch without using
  specialized frameworks such as spring, netty and others. This project
  was designed to practice knowledge and skills to write code in Java Core.

  The client side is written using JavaFX.

  In the application you can:
   communicate in real time,
   change Nickname without leaving the chat using the command //changeNick <New nickname>,
   register,
   send private messages.
